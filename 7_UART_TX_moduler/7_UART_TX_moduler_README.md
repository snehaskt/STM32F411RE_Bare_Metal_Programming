# 7_UART_TX_modular – Modular UART Driver | STM32 Bare-Metal

This project demonstrates how to implement a **modular UART driver** in STM32F411RE using **bare-metal Embedded C**. Instead of writing all code in `main.c`, the UART functionality is abstracted into reusable modules.

## 🔧 Features

- Modular driver design for `USART2` transmission
- Abstracts UART initialization and transmit functions
- Written using register-level access (CMSIS headers)
- Promotes code reuse and clarity for larger embedded projects
